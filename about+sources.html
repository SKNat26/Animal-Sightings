                    I created Encounter to help connect people through their environments. As someone who lives in NYC, I donâ€™t see much wildlife in my area. Other than the occasional pigeon or raccoon, my experience with animals is small. Many others such as me have become disconnected from the world around them. But what if people could share their experiences with wildlife digitally? Encounter allows you to blog about any animal you find and share your reports of animal sightings. Build a community and become aware of the environment around you!

                    How did this website come to be? It was thought of through the 2022 summer intensive program from All Star Codes. With many loose ends, this project was hastily done in about 5 days for Demo Day. However, the project was later perfected through the 6-week program, Tech Entrepreneurship Incubator, where it was made into a more practical website that would appeal to more people. The front-end was made with simple HTML and CSS and the back-end was made with JavaScript, Firebase, and a few APIs.
